# SLEEPMATE
High-Fidelity Prototype README

### Software Used
Our high-fidelity prototype was built using React Native and Expo. Development and testing for the prototype was conducted via Xcode’s iOS simulator. In particular, our application is optimized for iPhone X.

### Operating Instructions
In order to run the application, please do the following.
- Download the application repository either directly from GitHub (linked here) or from the Sleepmate website (linked here).
- Unzip the file and navigate to the unzipped folder via command prompt.
- Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.
- Run ```expo start```.
- Using a browser, navigate to the indicated port and select the iOS simulator. The application should then run on your computer.

### Hardcoded Elements
- On the “Roomies” page, we hard-coded the various roommate profiles (Derek Chung, Aaron Han, Michelle Xu, Emily Yang, Has No Friends) that can be added or deleted.
- On the “Stats” page, we hard-coded the conditions for the data for February 8-9, 9-10, and 10-11. Specifically, the “Sleep Quality” and “Ambient Noise Level” charts are generated at random. The statistics at the bottom are hard-coded.
- On the “Home” (Sleep) page, engaging the Sleep button will take you to 7:59 AM of the following morning, and the 8:00 AM alarm will sound 5 seconds afterwards. The wake-up time (8:00 AM) is hard-coded.
- On the “Notifs” page, we hard-coded 3 pre-existing messages (2 user messages from Derek Chung and Michelle Xu, respectively, and 1 system-side message from Sleepmate). The search bar is hard-coded to display only Derek Chung’s message no matter what is typed as a query; sending a message will result in the hard-coded personal reply: “Got it. Thanks for lmk!”. If the search bar is empty, any sent message will result in the hard-coded general reply: “Hi!”.
- On the “Profile” page, we hard-coded Tristan W. as the user profile (including the name, username, profile picture, and date joined).

### Limitations
- For the “Roomies” page, no roommates can be added or deleted besides the 5 sample roommates that exist on the screen when you first activate the app. As these contacts do not reflect actual user accounts, you can simulate the users accepting friend requests by clicking on the contact pending confirmation, and clicking the “Simulate user accepting request” button.
- For the “Stats” page, only 3 days’ worth of data exist. Because the app cannot actually track your sleep quality and ambient noise, no new data can be generated. The “Select Date” page does not have any actual functionality; clicking on a random date simply snaps you back to the statistics page you were viewing previously.
- For the “Home” (Sleep) page, the Sleep button does not activate any real sleep quality or ambient noise tracking capabilities.
- For the “Notifs” page, no actual notifications can be sent or received, aside from the auto-generated system-side notifications indicating that roommates have been added or deleted from the household.
- For the “Profile” page, no data exists for “Average Bedtime” or “Average Wakeup”. No such data can be generated by the app.
